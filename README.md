# Fibonacci Series

This repository contains an implementation of the Fibonacci series.
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts from 0 and 1, and the sequence goes like this:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Parneet-Sandhu/fibonacci-series.git
   cd fibonacci-series
   ```
2. Switch to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/Fibonacci-series
   ```
3. Run the code:
     ```bash
     python fibonacci.py
     ```

## Example Output
For input `n = 10`, the output will be:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```

## Pull Request
